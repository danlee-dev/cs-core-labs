# 📦 CS Core Labs

Welcome to the **CS Core Labs** repository!  
This hub gathers system-level computer science lab projects from core undergraduate courses, including:

- Computer Architecture 🖥️  
- Operating Systems ⚙️  
- Digital Logic Design 🔌 (coming soon)

## 📂 Projects

| Project Name | Description | Repository Link |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Digital Logic Circuits (Coming Soon) | Projects for digital logic design will be added soon. This includes combinational/sequential circuits and Logisim-based implementations. | _To be added_ |
| Multicycle Processor Implementation | A multicycle processor implementation for computer architecture coursework. Instructions are executed across multiple clock cycles with separate stages: fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. | [Go to repo](https://github.com/masonl2ee/242RCOSE22201.git) |
| CPU Scheduling | Source code implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin), developed for operating systems coursework. | [Go to repo](https://github.com/masonl2ee/251RCOSE34102.git) |

## How to Use

Each project is maintained in its own repository, and includes:
- Source code
- Simulation or test cases
- Project report or documentation (if applicable)

Refer to each repo’s `README.md` for specific build and usage instructions.
