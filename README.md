# 📦 CS Core Labs

Welcome to the **CS Core Labs** repository!  
This hub gathers system-level computer science lab projects from core undergraduate courses, including:

- Computer Architecture 
- Operating Systems 
- Digital Logic Design

---

## Projects

| Project Name | Description | Repository Link |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Digital Logic Circuits | Implementation of the Missionary and Cannibal problem using both combinational and sequential logic circuits. Includes gate-level optimization, FSM design, and achieves 1057MHz FMAX performance on Intel Arria II FPGA. | [Go to repo](https://github.com/danlee-dev/missionary-cannibal-digital-circuit) |
| Multicycle Processor Implementation | A multicycle processor implementation for computer architecture coursework. Instructions are executed across multiple clock cycles with separate stages: fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. | [Go to repo](https://github.com/masonl2ee/242RCOSE22201.git) |
| CPU Scheduling | Source code implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin), developed for operating systems coursework. | [Go to repo](https://github.com/masonl2ee/251RCOSE34102.git) |

## How to Use

Each project is maintained in its own repository, and includes:
- Source code
- Simulation or test cases
- Project report or documentation (if applicable)

Refer to each repo’s `README.md` for specific build and usage instructions.
