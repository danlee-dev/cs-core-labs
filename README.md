# cs-core-labs

This repository contains lab assignments and projects from core computer science courses, focusing on low-level systems and hardware understanding.

Included topics:
- 🖥️ Computer Architecture (e.g., multicycle processor design, datapath control)
- 🧠 Operating Systems (e.g., process scheduling, memory management)
- ⚙️ Digital Logic Design (e.g., combinational & sequential circuit implementations)

Each lab is organized by subject and includes source code, reports, and test cases when applicable.
